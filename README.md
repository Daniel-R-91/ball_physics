Ball Physics (Pygame)

A fun physics simulation game built with Python and Pygame.

Control a big ball that triggers smaller balls to bounce inside a box, demonstrating gravity, collisions, and friction. Watch the balls bounce realistically and come to rest naturally.

How to Play

When the game starts, a big ball moves across the screen.

When it reaches a certain point, it releases several small balls.

Watch the small balls bounce inside a confined box.

There are three speed settings to choose from: slow, medium, and fast.

Notes

Small balls bounce with gravity and friction and eventually stop moving.
